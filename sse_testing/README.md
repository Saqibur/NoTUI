Observations:
- I did not go too deep into how things work. Just messing around with default stuff I found online.
- No activity was observed until the client.php was specifically accessed.
- I guess it works.
- 3 seconds between each update.
- "Client-end" works independently.
- Did not face CORS issues with the php dev server. Might not always be the case.
