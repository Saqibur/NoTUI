# NoTUI

Through this project we intend to create a tangible user interface which eliminates the need to record notes on a device or through an app, but rather stays true to the traditional meaning of a note. That is, a person simple writes a note on a piece of paper, as per usual, and the system picks it up, and digitizes it.
